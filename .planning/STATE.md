## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 must establish RLS and tenant-isolation correctly from the first migration — highest-cost-to-fix-later item per research.
- [Roadmap]: Per-unit availability (CTLG-07) isolated into its own Phase 4, after units/catalog exist (Phase 3), to focus query-correctness work.
- [Roadmap]: WhatsApp message generation isolated into its own final phase (Phase 6) for dedicated encoding/device-testing focus.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- [Phase 1 planning]: Decide default availability rule for product/unit pairs with no explicit `product_availability` row (available vs. unavailable) — flagged by research as needing explicit decision before Phase 4.
- [Phase 1 planning]: Confirm `admin_users` single-table-with-role design (role + restaurant_id, server-side only, never client-writable).
- [Phase 1 planning]: Confirm ORM choice (Drizzle vs. raw supabase-js) for the schema/migrations.
- [Phase 3 planning]: Confirm whether "fotos" implies multi-photo galleries per product or a single `image_url` is sufficient for v1 (research recommends single column, additive `product_images` table later if needed).
